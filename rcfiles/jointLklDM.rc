ANALYSIS CONFIGURATION
######################

# channel to be analyzed (bb, tautau, mumu, WW, gammagamma, pi0pi0 or pi0gamma)
jointLklDM.Channel: bb

# process to be analyzed ("ann" or "dec" for annhilation and decay, respectively, default is annihilation
# (remember to change consistently the list of masses and J-factor value and uncertainty)
jointLklDM.Process: ann

# list of DM masses to be considered (in GeV)
jointLklDM.MassList:  100  200 500  1000  2000  5000  10000  20000  50000  100000

# Mean g (number of signal events) for simulations
# this should be replaced in future release by <sv>
# but the problem is that <sv> depends on the channel and mass through:
# g = <sv>*J/(8*Pi*m^2) * integral between fEpmin and fEpmax of fHdNdEpSignal
jointLklDM.mcG: 0

# if TRUE (FALSE) g is restricted to positive values only (i.e. Fermi prescription for lkl maximizing out of the physical region)
jointLklDM.isGpositive: TRUE

# Delta(-2logLkl) for limits (2.71 = 95% CL, 4.495 = 5sigma)

JOINT LIKELIHOOD CONFIGURATION
##############################

# Now include one line per likelihood function term, with the following general syntaxis:
#    jointLklDM.lklTerm<XXX>: <termType> <parentTerm> [<options>]
#
# where:
# <XXX>        is an unique index identifying the lkl term (appearing <XXX> indeces must be consecutive)
# <termType>   is the name of the class descibing the lkl term (JointLkl, Iact1dUnbinnedLkl, Iact1dBinnedLkl, FermiTables2016Lkl)
# <parentTerm> is the <XXX> index of a JointLkl term (with lower index) to which the lkl term is associated (or "-" for the main JointLkl term)
# <options>    is a list of different options, with format <opt1_name>=<opt1_value> ... <optN_name>=<optN_value>
#              All options are optional (there are default values defined in the class), and can be provided in an arbitrary order
#              The available options differ from class to class, a full description can be found in the documentation of the
#              class constructor, below we provide some examples.
#              Invalid options will be simply ignored, no error or warning message will be issued!

# -  Joint Likelihood:
#    jointLklDM.lklTerm<XXX>: JointLkl      <parentTerm> DlogJ=<DlogJ_value>

#
# <logJ             and <DlogJ> are, respectively, the mean value and uncertainty of the log10 of the J factor, in units of GeV^2 cm^-5 (annihilation) or GeV cm^-2 (decay)
# <inputFileName>   is the name of the input file, which contain the IRFs and data 
# <obsTime>         [hour] overrides the observation time provided as part of the input file for sensitivity/limit computation. For simulations, in addition, it is used to compute how many events need to be simulated
# <nbins>           and
# <minbincontent>   are the number of bins and minimum number of events in each bin, in Iact1dBinnedLkl objects
# <tau>             overrides the tau value provided at the data file. For simulations, in addition, it is used to compute how many events need to be simulated
# <DtauStat>        overrides statistical uncertainty in tau provided at the data file. For simulations, in addition, it is used to compute how many events need to be simulated
# <DtauSyst>        is the relative systematic uncertainty in tau (the Off/On normalization factor), e.g. if DtauSyst=0.015 an uncertaintyof 0.015*tau will be added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty (from data file or rc file).
#                   For simulations, in addition, it is used to compute how many events need to be simulated
# <tauEDepFluct>    can be TRUE or FALSE (default). If true, tau will be allowed to fluctuate independently from energy bin to energy bin
# <dndepbkgfromoff> can be TRUE or FALSE (default). If true, the background distribution (fHdNdEpBkg, for simulations) will be constructed from Off data distribution
# <knownBackground> can be TRUE or FALSE (default). If true, b_i (i=1,...,Nbins) are fixed parameters (as opposed to nuisance). This option is for tests mainly
# <isoffason>       can be TRUE or FALSE (default). If true,  use the Off sample (data or simulatiosn) as if it was the On (for tests). This option is for tests mainly
#
# NOTES:
# - The object for which the minimization is called is lklTerm000, all the other terms should be directly or indirectly associated to lklTerm000 by
#   the relations described by the <parentTerm> values, in an arbitrarily complex tree structure
# - When several terms share the same logJ and dLogJ, the corresponding value of logJ must be specified for each of them, whereas the value of
#   dLogJ only once for their common parent term. This is so because logJ is used to transform excess events into <sv> units whereas a non-zero
#   DlogJ indicates that the uncertainty in the units of a particular lkl term is an *independent* random variable.
